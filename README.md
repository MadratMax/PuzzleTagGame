# PuzzleTag Game (#Dobble) 

PuzzleTag (Dobble) is a game designed for memory training and improvement—and it’s also just for fun! :)

Copy the PuzzleTagImages folder to C:\. You can update appSettings.json to specify a different folder location if needed. In the corresponding section of appSettings.json, you can also set up to three player names.

There are three ways to get images for the game:

Prepare 16 images within the Images folder, inside a directory named after the desired category. (For optimal resolution, use image dimensions of width: 180px x height: 190px).
Use the generate (генерация) function in settings to find random images of a specified category.
Use the paint (рисовать) function in settings to create custom images. Make 16 unique images and enjoy your own creations!
Build and run PuzzleTag.exe. Press ESC to open the settings menu.

Enjoy the game!
